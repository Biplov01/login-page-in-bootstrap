# login-page-in-bootstrap
A login page is a web page or an entry page to a website that requires user identification and authentication, regularly performed by entering a username and password combination. Logins may provide access to an entire site or part of a website. Logging in not only provides site access for the user, but also allows the website to track user actions and behavior. Logging off a webpage or site may be manual by the user or they can occur automatically when certain conditions (such as closing the page, turning off the computer, a long time delay, etc.) occur.

Some websites use cookies to track users during their logged in sessions. Generally, these cookies will turn off when the user logs out. Those cookies that are automatically deactivated and deleted from the user’s computer are calledsession-only cookies. Protective measures that delete and invalidate associations between a user’s handle and the session help assure users that logins can happen from any location, including public computers.
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************There are various different advantages of Bootstrap, a few of them are given below:

The first and foremost advantage of using Bootstrap is that it is very easy to use and implement. If a person has some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, that user can easily use Bootstrap.
The fact that Bootstrap can adapt to the size of any phone, tablet, desktop and so on is also very interesting feature.
Bootstrap 4 is also useful because it is compatible with all modern browsers which include Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Opera.
It also produces less cross-browser bugs.
It is light weighted and consequently it can be widely used as a framework for creating responsive sites.
Lastly, Bootstrap 4 is a very simple and yet very effective grid system.
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Why should one use Bootstrap?

There are multiple reasons for that, such as:

It is a way more fast and simpler way to develop websites.
It can create platform-independent web pages.
It can also create responsive web pages.
The web pages created by using Bootstrap 4 can be easily made responsive.
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

As of April 2022, Bootstrap is the eleventh most starred project on GitHub, with over 156,000 stars.

Feature:

Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.

The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the width of the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the screen showing the page:

Smaller than 576 pixels
576–768 pixels
768–992 pixels
992–1200 pixels
Larger than 1200 pixels
